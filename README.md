## ✒️ General Information 
Wake up Wardogs! We have a target to destroy. 🚀

Odin Landing is a static website for The Odin Project (TOP) containing information on the PS2 video game, Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War.

Discover this fifth installment of the Ace Combat series. Personally, one of the coolest game I have played on the PlayStation 2 console.
<br/>

**🛈 About Ace Combat 5:**

Ace Combat 5: The Unsung War was developed by Project Aces and released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004 by Namco. The campaign revolves around the protagonist "Blaze," a fighter pilot who commands the Wardog Squadron. The Unsung War highlights the actions of this squadron as they try to stop the enemy invasion and learn the truth about the warfare.

<br/>

## ❤️ Motivation
The main aim of Odin Landing is to better understand how to effectively make use of Flexbox and Grid while applying all the knowledge obtained from the previous project, [Odin Recipes](https://github.com/MisterValiant/odin-recipes "Odin Recipes") in the Fullstack Web Development curriculum of The Odin Project (TOP).
